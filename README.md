OnePiece-TwoMovements:
● The user needs to input the start position of a playing piece on the grid and how
many moves left or right (L or R) and how many moves up or down (U or D)
● An example of a user input: “E4 3R 2D” -> this is piece is at E4 and the movement is
3 blocks right and then 2 blocks down
● After the user input, the program needs to move the piece as per the user instruction
● The program also needs to move a “phantom” piece in the opposite direction of the
instructions, ie (3R would move the “phantom” piece 3 blocks left and 2D would move
the “phantom” piece 2 blocks up.
● The program must output the current position of the piece and the phantom piece.
Eg. Input: “E4 3R 2D”
Output: piece: H2, phantom piece: B6

● Each lottery line has have 5 different numbers [between 1 and 50] and a bonus

unique lottery lines.

not be repeated in the line except for the bonus
